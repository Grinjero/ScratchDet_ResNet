# Modularized SSD implementation in TensorFlow

This repo tries to implement SSD in a modularized fashion.  
Inspiration: Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors. (arXiv:1611.10012)

## Acknowledgement
This repo is based on the works:
* [SSD-Tensorflow](https://github.com/balancap/SSD-Tensorflow/): The Tensorflow re-implementation of Caffe SSD.
* [SSD_tensorflow_VOC](https://github.com/LevinJ/SSD_tensorflow_VOC)
* [modular_SSD_tensorflow](https://github.com/fisheess/modular_SSD_tensorflow) Fork of given repository with added implementation of ScratchDet with the Root ResNet 18 backbone
This is the baseline of my implementation.
